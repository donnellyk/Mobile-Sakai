Thanks to iWebKit Team (http://www.iwebkit.net) and  Sakai (http://sakaiproject.org)

Please build on this as you see fit or just use it as a learning tool for Sakai SOAP programming. Don't make the same mistakes I did!

Feel free to email me if you have any quesitons about my code or Sakai in general (Their JavaDoc is spotty and takes some time to get a feel for)
